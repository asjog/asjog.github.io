## Using conda envs 
Situation: You have a python installation (or a conda environment) that is 
installed in root that you can't edit and you need to add your packages to do your own work.
Based on my understanding of virtual environments, the ideal way to work in this scenario is
to clone the root environment into your user space and work with the clone.

```
$> conda create --prefix /home/username/my_env --clone="/usr/python/anaconda2.7/envs/root_env"
```
This creates the environment, but if you try to see if conda lists it, using 
```
$> conda list envs
```
you will only see environments created by root. To activate my_env you need to give the full path to my_env
```
$> source activate /home/username/my_env
```
