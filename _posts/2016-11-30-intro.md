title: Hello and नमस्कार

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Image Analysis and Communications Laboratory](http://www.iacl.ece.jhu.edu)
My research interests are in medical image analysis, computer vision, and machine learning.

At IACL I have been involved in:

* Image synthesis of brain MRI to enable consistent image analysis
* Tongue motion analysis during speech using cine MRI, tagged MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging of the tongue
* Building neuroimage processing pipelines for efficient and reproducible image analysis


I completed my Ph.D in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu) at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), where I was advised by [Dr. Jerry L. Prince](http://iacl.ece.jhu.edu/index.php/Prince) at the [Image Analysis and Communications Laboratory (IACL)](https://www.iacl.ece.jhu.edu). I developed novel image synthesis algorithms for brain MRI images and demonstrated several successful applications for synthetic MRI images.
You can read my [thesis](pdfs/thesis-amod-jog-2016.pdf) here.

From 2009-2011, I was a research assistant at the Visual Imaging and Surgical Robotics (VISR) lab at the Laboratory for [Computational Sensing and Robotics](https://www.lcsr.jhu.edu) working with Dr. Rajesh Kumar to develop objective skill-assessment criteria for surgeons using the da Vinci surgical robot.   

Previously, I earned my B.Tech degree in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in). At IITB, I worked with [Dr. Sharat Chandran](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sharat) and also interned with [Dr. Anant Madabhushi](https://www.case.edu/medicine/ccir/faculty/anant-madabhushi-phd.html) at Rutgers University. My undergraduate research experience sparked my interest in medical image analysis.
